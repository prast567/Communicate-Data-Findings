# Communicate-Data-Findings

The previous three lessons in the course have been focused on exploratory analyses. In phases with exploratory visualizations, the primary audience for the visuals will be you, the analyst. The plots that have been created and demonstrated haven't been particularly polished, just descriptive enough for you to gain insights into the data.

This project is focused on taking those insights which were found meaninful during exploratory visualizations and creating explanatory analyses. Here, your audience will be broader: My goal will be to convey my findings to other people who don't have the level of hands-on experience with the data as me. Visualizations under this banner will be focused on telling the story about the reantal bike records for the company named bay-wheels
